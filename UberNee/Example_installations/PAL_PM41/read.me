a little vague, but here it is. 

SubQ clock and SubQ Data points etc. here: https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide/psnee/pm-41/


Updated with actual installation photos: I am using an alternate D2 BIOS point. The chip is affixed with a couple drops of superglue over the IC there - it's a perfect place to fit the board. You can insulate with tape before applying the top shield.

This location was specifically chosen for the fit as you can see.
INSULATE the top of the chip with electrical tape.
A few drops of superglue were used to adhere it here - this is easy to break the bond if ever required by use of a heatgun.

Also, feel free to use VCC instead of RAW for the power pin, this will be fine.

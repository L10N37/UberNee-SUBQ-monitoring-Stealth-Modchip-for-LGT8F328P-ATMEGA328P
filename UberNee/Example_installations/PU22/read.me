This may be a tight fit, I ended up removing the reset button so it couldn't be pressed by the top plate - though it worked without doing this.
Feel free to install however you like, but these are the points.

I recently refurbished a PU22 that had an "elf 168 stealth chip" (black blob IC on a tiny PCB)
This was ripped out and i put UberNee in but this particular system flat out rejected the SCEx injection point. I switched to the OG point used on other chips and all was fine.

Also, feel free to use VCC instead of RAW for the power pin, this will be fine.

Colour correction for PAL60 (or use the XTAL hack, which doesn't fix subcarrier for scaler use ..equal to DFO, only corrects freq) + Gate wire for the interim (haven't figured out software PWM, the chip lacks hardware PWM) - THIS IS NOT REALLY REQUIRED THESE DAYS, PU20+ DO NTSC443 FROM FACTORY WHICH DISPLAYS IN COLOUR

Gate wire is for genuine import support, also fixes genuine discs of the regions consoles, if you're only using originals of correct region and backups of all regions, not required.

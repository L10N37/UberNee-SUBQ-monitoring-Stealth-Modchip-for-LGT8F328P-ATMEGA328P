Created local repository


Insallation:

-Shut down Arduino IDE.

Optional back up of old files:
-Save files from C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\LGT8fx Boards\hardware\avr\1.0.6 folder to somewhere else.


Installation:
-Deleted and replace or Overwrite all files in ...\LGT8fx Boards\hardware\avr\1.0.6 with the files in the lgt8f-1.0.7-alpha.1.zip archive (extract the files!)
in the lgt8f subfolder.


Ready to go:
-Start Arduino IDE.


Please note the tested boards are the LGT8F328P QFP32 including the miniature version with no USB port (you need a serial to USB, the part# XC4464 from Jaycar is pin
compatible / plug in as is, then remove, though I have mine modified to output 3.3v and hardwired for 3.3v logic levels).

There is a new 20 pin SSOP version floating about which is yet to be tested, but should work.

Just a folder for tested arduinos, check images

The clone version with the Atmega 168 pictured doesn't seem to be very trust worthy, I've had one erase itself over night and then require reflashing. No issues with the 368.

There are red PCB's that look just like the 368 clone, but are 168's, most of these haven't worked. They flash properly everytime but just don't seem to go. They work fine for PSXTAL (the dual region mod, another project)
